<p dir="auto">Hi I am a undergraduate student in the fourth year of Computer Science program. Right now I am applying for graduate school and I am very interested in
Robotics and I also have some background knowledges of NLP and Computer Vision. Some possible answers that I got after I consulted some senior year graduate students and practitioners in the industry. And I would like to share it out to recent CS background students who have the same anxiety like me.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you have great abilities, it's not impossible to do it all. To understand the concept of embodied intelligence, you can take a look at the CVPR 2022 Embodied AI Workshop and be pleasantly surprised to find that robots, CV, NLP can even be combined together!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Looking ahead at the next 2 to 3 years, it will be Embodied AI and Robot Learning control But the window of opportunity may be very short, just a few years. To add my opinion on embodied intelligence, it is actually a new generation of HCI/HRI concept platform in a sense. It is equivalent to providing an open source community with a platform that can efficiently integrate visual/voice/flexible devices/mechanical/electronic/wireless technologies and elements to form a product. Big shots define the connections and pipelines of various hardware or software technologies on this platform. Then open-source players can create various low-cost but potentially efficient devices on their own wheels at low cost. Create your own brand and produce products that are well done. The core of this generation of platforms is parallel simulation, where you can use computing resources to solve the design validation iteration cycle of product development. That is to say, when designing a product, you don't need to actually make or sample it. You can simulate it first, and you can simulate many different designs at the same time to verify a set of useful config. Then, you can use it for sample making, which greatly improves the success rate, reduces costs, and saves a lot of valuable time. This is fundamentally different from previous product development. The application of hand eye coordination robots has cooled down around 19-20 years ago, along with a batch of autonomous driving. Hand eye coordination mainly relies on visual sensors combined with traditional industrial robotic arms for logistics automation or factory automation applications. Later on, it was mainly due to the variability of actual demand, as well as the so-called paradox (seemingly simple tasks for humans may be very difficult for automated systems) and factors such as input-output ratio ROI, as well as price wars among several major manufacturers, which have led to a thin profit margin for this industry to this day. The current trend is that all manufacturers who initially focused on hand eye coordination applications either specialize in sensors or become integrated integrators introducing more devices such as AGVs to provide full process solutions. They cannot attract customers solely based on the technical threshold of one or two applications, but can only focus on quantity and dimension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The first principles of this era are no longer about tasks or directions, but about the models you create. Your choice of direction has no meaning at all. No matter what direction you choose, you can do LLM/VLM/diffusion. Doing these is the way to go. If you don't do these, choosing any direction is probably a dead end in my opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">I personally think the next trend should be in the direction of robotics. The heyday of CV (from around 2012 to 2019, not rigorous, completely based on my own feelings) has passed, and startups in the CV industry are hot. At that time, as long as startups were related to the CV direction and had a good business story, it was easy to raise funds. Currently, the commercialization direction of CV is approaching maturity; The peak of NLP lies in the present, with chatgpt as the representative of big language models, which really impress everyone. Various big models are still being explored for open source and commercialization, and it is estimated that the next 2-3 years will be a period of large-scale landing and exploration of LLM, accompanied by the birth of a large number of startups; The reason why robots can be considered as the future development direction is that robots are the culmination of various disciplines such as vision, language, control, and mechanics. From the perspective of various science fiction movies, they have given people too much beautiful imagination. This is also beginning to emerge at present, and many companies have begun to layout humanoid robots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Personal recommendation: The difference between robots and CV lies in the emphasis of their knowledge systems. Although the manifestation in work is to obtain the target state through matrix operations with the help of computers, robots have requirements for motion learning, and relatively speaking, the limitations of professional knowledge will be greater. Those who study communication, electronic information, computer science, and mechanics can all study computer vision, but most of those who want to study robots are studying control. So if we consider it from the perspective of employment, CV will be more competitive because the entry threshold is relatively lower (although it is also very high, I cannot understand my colleagues' work at all) PS: Currently, there is a shortage of people in the market who work on robot algorithms. Due to the different knowledge and theory systems, the employment direction is relatively different, and the employment area of robots will be narrower, because most of the companies that make robots are technology companies that have to do cv, but many Internet companies do not necessarily need to do cv, and its application scope is broader. Ps: At present, there are fewer positions for robot algorithms in the market (companies cannot recruit people, job seekers cannot find jobs, it's really out of the big picture). Both directions are excellent, and it depends more on personal interests and hobbies. After graduating in three years, you can't say what the market will look like at the bottom, after all, AI is so hot now. Personally, I prefer the direction of robotics, as I believe that allowing a lifeless machine to perform various tasks excellently under its own design would be a great sense of achievement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">This question should be very simple, let's confirm two points. Choose whichever direction you are interested in. Which direction do you think will bring you huge benefits (such as future salary)? If the two are similar, then choose the one that interests you. If there is a significant difference and you feel that you lack money, then choose the one with higher returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Employment. Currently, robots and computer vision have good employment prospects and development potential. The robot direction may have a slight advantage, but the other two directions are also broad. Guidance teachers and research conditions. Excellent mentors and hardware equipment are crucial for scientific research. Understand the specific situation of each university in these areas before considering your choice. A plan to pursue further studies abroad. If you plan to go abroad, the more mainstream CV and NLP directions may be more easily recognized by well-known foreign schools. The breadth of research interests. The direction of robots is relatively narrow, while CV and NLP involve a wider range. Make a decision after considering these factors comprehensively. Personally, if one is interested and confident enough in robots, they will prioritize this direction; If you want to develop more broadly, CV or NLP are also good choices. But there is no absolute standard answer, it still depends on individual circumstances</p>
